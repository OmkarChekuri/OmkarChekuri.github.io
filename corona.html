<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    The above example shows a coordination visualization in D3 using the live properties Architecture. The data for the following visualization is 
    gathered from    <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"  target="_blank">Corona Example</a>. 
</p>




<h2> Interface</h2>
 
<p> Different views are organized column wise</p>

<ul>
    <li> The first column from left  consists of two scatterplot views.The Top Left scatterplot shows <em> Tests Per Million</em>
       drawn on horizontal axis vs <em>Cases Per Million</em> on vertical Axis. The Bottom Left scatterplot shows <em>
          Deaths Per Million</em> drawn on horizontal axis vs <em>Tests Per Million</em> on vertical Axis  </li>

    <li> The second column from left shows a Table view that  shows all the data set. THe Continent coloumn is colored based on
       the  categorical color legend assigned to continent.</li>
    <li> The third column from left  shows a Choropleth Map shows a Mercator projection of the world map. Each continent is colored based on the categorical color 
        legend assigned to continent</li>
    <li>The fourth column from left shows a Bubble chart view shows various bubbles drawn using size to represent the size of the circle </li>
    <li>The fifth column from left  shows a Parallel coordinate plot that is drawn using the same data. The color of the paths is drawn using categorical color legend assigned to 
        attribute of the continent </li>
</ul>
<p> All the views use the color encoding from  <a href = "https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3" target= "_blank"> color brewer 2.0 </a>
   website to encode the color with the continent that the attribute belongs to.</p>

<h2>Coordination</h2>
<p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The two scatterplots on the first column from the left are coordinated by the range property.  The Horizontal range of the top 
      scatterplot is coordinated with the vertical range of bottom scatterplot.
    </li>
     <li> The top scatterplot in the first column and the choropleth Map are coordinated in selection. Any selection made in either of the above will reflect in other.</li>
    <li>
      The bottom scatterplot in the first column, table view and the Parallerl coordinate plot are coordinated in selection. Any selection made in the scatterplot view 
      or table view will show the selected items in the three coordinated plots.
    </li>
    <li>
      The scatterplots, table view, Choropleth map and  bubble chart are coordinated in indication. Any item hovered in table view, Choropleth map and  bubble chart will be 
      highlighted in other plots.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Interaction</h2>

<h3>Scatter Plot</h3>
<p>
    The current implementation supports either Zoom or brush on the scatterplot at a time. we decided to implement brush property instead.
    Brushing can be done in the scatterplot view by clicking the mouse anywhere on the scatterplot followed by drag and release to select 
    a brushed region. Brusing in the above implementation is performed using rectangular brushed regions. Any items that fall in the brushed region 
    are selected. Selected items are shown in the  scatterplot using a black colored stroke.
</p>   

<h3>Table View</h3>
<p>
   selection in table view is done by double clicking on the row for selecting a single element. For selecting multiple rows click on a row and drag the mouse 
   to the top or bottom based ont the direction in which the selection is to be made. There are performance issues associated with multiple row selection in case 
   of table view in the current implementation which will be addressed soon which causes the multiple selection to not perform consistently always. The selected
   rows have a red colored text font. Indication is done in table view by hovering the mouse over the row. The indicated row is shown using a "teal" background color. 

</p>
 

<h3>Choropleth Map</h3>
Selection is done on the choropleth map by clicking twice on a country with a small time gap between clicks otherwise the interaction will also 
trigger zoom along with selection. Selected regions are filled with grey color. Indication is done by hovering the mouse over the country. Indicated regions 
will be highlighted with a blue border and a reduced opacity.
<p>

</p>

<h3>Bubble Chart</h3>
<p>
  Selection is done on the bubble chart by clicking twice on a bubble. Selected items are filled with grey color. Indication is done by hovering the 
  mouse over the bubble. Indicated items will be highlighted with a white border and a reduced opacity.
</p>
<h3>Parallel Coordinate Plot</h3>
<p>
   The above parallel coordinate plot does not allow selectioon or hovering. It will only display selected items when selected in a corresponding coordinated view.
