   <b>C4D3</b> is a framework that provides view level abstraction and coordination architecture for developing coordinated  multiple 
   views in using <b>D3.js</b> library. The journey to developing the C4D3 framework began when we discovered the potential and need of a coordination architecture 
   for building coordinated multiple views(CMV) for the visualizations built in browser environment. We chose to adopt LiveProperties 
   architecture for this purpose after understanding its potential and generalizability.

<h3> Planning and Understanding phase.</h3>
<p>
  We started the plan the capabilities we intended to provide the visualization system. We started to understand the 


</p>


<h3> Design and Analysis phase.</h3>
<p>
    We started to design the sketch of the framework and analysed how different aspects of the need to be implemented. We chose 
    Live properties architecture of the Improvise visualization system which is the coordination architecture for improvise 
    to be the coordination architecture for the C3D4.

</p>

<h3> Developing the coordination architecture and view abstractions.</h3>
<p>
  We started conversion of the Live Properties package which is written in Java into javascript. Soon we encountered many
  difficulties associated with the conversion as javascript is not object oriented. We also faced difficulties due to its limited 
  features like lack of strict typing, support of optional parameters, support during compilation. We moved our code to typescript 
  as it provides the advantages needed for clean one on one conversion of Java Code to Typescript code.
  We carefully implemented all the functionality supported by Typescript library and found alternative solutions for the cases where
  typescript do not provide the exact functionality that Java provides.   
  
  We  created View Level abstractions for Html and SVG widgets (Sliders, text boxes, numerical input, rectangles) to make them work
  with the coordination architecture.


</p>

<h3> Developing initial version of C4D3 framework.</h3>
   
<p>
    We combined the coordination architecture and view level abstractions to build the initial version of C4D3.
</p>
<h3> Testing the coordination for HTML and SVG views using C4D3.</h3>

<p>
    We created multiple coordinated views using the HTML and SVG widgets to test the working of C4D3 framework.

</p>


<h3> Extending the coordination architecture and view abstraction for D3.js library</h3>
<p>
      Once the framework is in place we started to develop view level abstractions for D3 visualizations like 
      scatterplots, Table view, Parallel coordinate plot, Choropleth Map Bubble chart and Bargraph.We started 
      developing abstracting the appearence and behaviour of the visualizations to support basic selection  
      and navigation patterns.
</p>
<h3> Building examples of Coordinated visualizations using C4D3.</h3>

<p>
  We created two examples of complex coordinated visualization using the C4D3 framework. One of the them 
  being partial reimplementation of the Ions visualization created using Improvise and the other one being a
  novel implementation of Covid19 visualization from the Covid19 Dataset.
