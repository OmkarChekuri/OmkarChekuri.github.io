    <h1>Testing of C4D3 framework</h1>

<svg  height ="800px"></svg>

<p>
  The above example visualization is used to test the coordination architecture of the initial version of C4D3 using the view abstractions built for the SVG and Html elements.
  In the above example, the code for the sliders, rectangles and numerical input elements is modularized such that these views can be instantiated any number of times.   
</p>
<p>
  In the above example, the different sliders, numerical input elements and rectangles are coordinated in many combinations. 
  The numerical input from widget named pixel1 is coordinated in width and height of the rectangles in canvas1 and canvas3, slider input of widget named slider1.
  The numerical input from widget named pixel2 is coordinated in width and height of the rectangles in canvas2 , slider input of widget named slider2.
  The numerical input from widget named pixel3 is coordinated with numerical input from widget named pixel4, in width  of the rectangles in canvas3 , slider inputs of widgets named slider3 and slider4.
