   <b>C4D3</b> is a framework that provides view level abstraction and coordination architecture for developing coordinated  multiple 
   views using <b>D3</b> library. The journey to developing the C4D3 framework began when we discovered the potential and need of a coordination architecture 
   for building coordinated multiple views (CMV) for the visualizations built in browser environment. We chose to adopt Live properties 
   architecture for this purpose after understanding its potential and generalizability. The whole process can be roughly categorized into following steps. 
   
   
   <ol>
     <li> Planning and understanding phase</li>
     <li> Design and analysis phase</li>
     <li> Developing the  <b>coordination </b> architecture and <b>view abstractions</b></li>
     <li> Developing and testing of initial version of <b>C4D3</b> framework</li>
     <li> Extending the coordination architecture and view abstraction for <b>D3</b> library</li>
     <li> Building <b>examples</b> of complex coordinated visualizations using <b>C4D3</b> framework</li>
   </ol>
</p>


<h3> Planning and understanding phase</h3>
<p>
  Our aim of this project was to develop a coordination framework for the web environment where users should be able to build complex coordinated visualizations
  in the browser environment by achieving comparative performance to that of the desktop applications. We creating a rough plan of what the visualization framework
  might work like , design of the user interface of the visualization and how  a visualization designer might use the library to build visualizations using 
  D3 library.
  
  To understand how a coordinated visualization works with Html and SVG widgets, we created simple Html and SVG widgets and started coordinating them in a 
  variaty of ways. For example we used sliders to manipulate the DOM and various properties of SVG objects. As a process we gained better 
  understanding of how the program gets complex with increasing number of coordinations between the widgets.
  Check the <b><em><a style="color: red;" href="./planning.html" target="_blank" > Planning Playground </a></em></b> link  to view the example visualization.

</p>

<h3> Design and analysis phase</h3>
<p>
  The design and analysis started with discussions about the level of abstraction provided for the user. We started to design and sketch  the framework
  and analysed how different aspects need to be implemented. We chose Live properties coordination architecture of the
  <a href="https://www.cs.ou.edu/~weaver/improvise/index.html">Improvise </a> visualization system to be the coordination architecture for  C4D3.

</p>

<h3> Developing the coordination architecture and view abstractions</h3>
<p>
  We started conversion of the Live Properties package which is written in Java into Javascript. Soon we encountered many
  difficulties associated with the conversion as Javascript is not object oriented. We also faced difficulties due to its limited 
  features like lack of strict typing, support of optional parameters, support during compilation. We moved our code to typescript 
  as it provides the advantages needed for clean one on one conversion of Java Code to Typescript code. We carefully implemented 
  essential functionality of coordination architecture supported by Typescript library.   
  
  We created view level abstractions for Html and SVG widgets (slider, text box, numerical input, rectangle) to make them work
  with the coordination architecture.


</p>

<h3> Developing and testing of initial version of C4D3 framework</h3>
   
<p>
    We combined the coordination architecture and view level abstractions to build the initial version of C4D3. The framework was combined 
    in such a way that the user will be able to create the variables, instantiate the views using view abstractions and parameters, define the
    coordinations between various views in a central location. This gives the user the ability and abstraction required to define the coordinations
    between different views in a clean and centralized manner. This also gives the user the much needed control to change the coordination between views 
    without the need to change the D3 code that builds the visualization. Our limited experience in building browser based visualization systems cost us
    most of our time in the development of the initial version of framework. Our main challenges here include setting up the softwoare environment 
    for the testing and debugging of the framework for iterative development of the framework.
</p>

<p>
    We created multiple coordinated views using the Html and SVG widgets to test the working of C4D3 framework.
    Check the <b><em><a style="color: red;" href="./testing.html" target="_blank" > Testing Playground </a></em></b> link  to view the example visualization. 


</p>


<h3> Extending the coordination architecture and view abstraction for D3 library</h3>
<p>
     Once the framework is in place we started to develop view level abstractions for D3 visualizations like scatterplot, table view,
     parallel coordinate plot, choropleth map, bubble chart and bargraph. We started abstracting the appearence and behaviour of the visualizations 
     to support basic selection and navigation patterns. The D3 typings for typescript are essential for building and extending the architecture to
     D3 library. Lack of typescript typings for other available visualization libraries limited out testing and experimenting on extending the architecture 
     to support them. Some of the challenges faced in this step include making changes to the view abstractions for updating the
     views in an efficient manner without impacting the performance of the browser although some performance issues may be noticed.  
</p>

<h3> Building examples of coordinated visualizations using C4D3</h3>
<p>
  Once the required view types in D3 are ready, we created two examples of complex coordinated visualizations using the C4D3 framework. One of the them 
  being partial reimplementation of the <b><a href = "https://www.cs.ou.edu/~weaver/improvise/examples/ions/index.html" > Ions visualization    </a> </b>
  originally created using  <a href="https://www.cs.ou.edu/~weaver/improvise/index.html">Improvise </a> and the other one being a novel implementation of
  <b>Covid19 visualization</b> from the Covid19 dataset. The <b>links</b> to the above <b>examples</b> are provided in the navigation bar on the top of page
  under <strong>Examples</strong> section. As and when required to support different interaction behaviour for the visualization examples, we extended 
  the functionality of the view abstractions for the views   to support complex coordinated visualizations. We parameterised essential behaviour and appearence
  of the D3 views to give the designer ability to instantiate the views using the view wrappers provided. These view wrappers does not cover all the possibile 
  design choices to be made. Any special appearence and behaviour that the designer needs and the view does not provide will require minimal work from the designer in modifying the view 
  abstractions. We aim to modify the framework to let the user inherit the view abstraction provided and define their special code in a sub class.
