 <h2>Requirements</h2>
 
<p>C4D3  Is JavasScript program built using node package manager. It is only tested to work on windows platform. It was supposed to work just like any node.js application on other platforms. It requires visual studio code, TypeScript 2.4.2 or later, D3.js v5.
 
  Although visual studio code is not a necessity for node.js applications, for the current example you might need it if you want to run the examples out of the box. C4D3 is not a completed software. It is in active development . 
  It is research-grade software with known bugs and should be considered a prototype.</p>

 
 <h2>Running examples built in C4D3</h2>
 
 <P>The current version of C4D3 is 0.1.0. To run the examples built using C4D3</P> 
 <ol>

  <li>Install visual studio code for windows with live server plugin.</li>

   <li>Download one of the following: 

      <ul>
        <li><a href="media/C4D3-Covid19.zip"><h4 style="margin: 5px;">Example 1: Covid19-Viz</h4> <img src="./media/download-button.png"  style="width:100px; height:40px; margin-left:100px;"></a> </li>
        <li><a href="media/C4D3-Ions.zip" > <h4 style="margin: 0px;">Example 2: Ions-Viz</h4>     <img src="./media/download-button.png"  style="width:100px; height:40px; margin-left:100px;"></a> </li>
     
     </ul>

    </li>

<li>Unzip the file  and go to folder named "build".</li>
 <li> Next Right click on the index.html file and run with live server.</li>   
  
 </ol> 


 
 
<p>
 I am happy to discuss ideas for research collaboration with people in the visualization,
  including ideas that involve interdisciplinary applications to complex sources of information 
  particularly if they involve coordinated multiple views and multi-dimensional data.
</p>

<p>
  However, despite the availability of the C4D3 source code under the AGPLv3, we are not looking 
  for help with development of the C4D3 software architecture or user interface from the general open source community at this time.
</p>


<h2>Building examples using C4D3 </h2>
<p> For building examples using C4D3 please follow the documentation provided in the readme file for the examples above. </p> 
<h2> Support</h2>

 <p>
  C4D3 is a software framework intended to explore and build coordinated multiple visualizations using D3.js library. You might encounter 
  D3 code that may not be perfect or incorrect sometimes. The current version of the software is only intended to showcase the coordination capabilities of the C4D3 arcitecture
  with common D3 examples. It is not intended to provide optimized and correct D3 code without any errors. Contact me with questions regarding how to construct view abstractions,
  using the C4D3 architecture and how to coordinate the visualizations. 

 </p>  
 
 <p>You are welcome to contact me with comments or general queries with examples built using C4D3. C4D3 is currently limited in terms of documentation and tutorials.
  We are currently working on creating improving documentation and developing helpful  <b><a style="font-size: 18px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpSPYc7_WPvTamlbw3Lsjc91TiyNop95q">resources.</a></b>
