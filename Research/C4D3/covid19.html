<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    The above example shows a coordination visualization in D3 using the Live properties architecture of 
    <a href="https://www.cs.ou.edu/~weaver/improvise/index.html">Improvise </a> software. The data for the following visualization was 
    gathered from <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"  target="_blank">worldometer</a> website. 
</p>




<h2> Interface</h2>
 
<p> Clicking on the image shown above will open the visualization in a new window. Different views are organized column wise. Each view is embedded in a rectanglular region with a <b>thick border</b> on the top. Each view can be independently
   moved and the <b>interface</b> can be <b>reorganized</b> by clicking and dragging the <b>thick border</b> on the top of each view.  
     </p> 

<ul>
    <li> The first column from left  consists of two <b>scatter plots</b>.The top left scatter plot shows <b><em> Tests Per Million</em></b>
       variable drawn on horizontal axis vs <b><em>Cases Per Million</em></b> variable on vertical axis. The bottom left scatter plot shows <b><em>
          Deaths Per Million</em></b> variable drawn on horizontal axis vs <b><em>Tests Per Million</em></b> variable drawn on vertical axis  </li>

    <li> The second column from left shows a <b>table view</b>  that shows all the data set. The continent coloumn of the table view is colored based on
       the  categorical color assigned to each continent as per the legend shown in the choropleth map and bubble chart in the third and fourth columns respectively.</li>
    <li> The third column from left  shows a <b>choropleth map</b> using mercator projection of the world map. Each continent is colored based on the categorical color 
        assigned to continent</li>
    <li>The fourth column from left shows a <b>bubble chart</b> and a selection menu with various bubbles drawn using radius of the circle to represent in the drop down menu. </li>
    <li>The fifth column from left  shows a <b>parallel coordinate plot</b> that is drawn using the same data. The color of the paths is drawn using categorical color assigned to 
        attribute of the continent. </li>
</ul>
<p> All the views use the color encoding from  <a href = "https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3" target= "_blank"> ColorBrewer 2.0 </a>
   website.</p>

<h2>Coordination</h2>
<p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The two scatter plots on the first column from the left are coordinated by the range property.  The horizontal range of the top 
      scatter plot is coordinated with the vertical range of bottom scatter plot.
    </li>
     <li> The top scatter plot in the first column and the choropleth Map are coordinated in selection. Any selection made in either of the above views will reflect in other.</li>
    <li>
      The bottom scatter plot in the first column, table view and the parallerl coordinate plot are coordinated in selection. Any selection made in the scatterplot view 
      or table view will reflect the selected items in the three coordinated plots.
    </li>
    <li>
      The scatter plots, table view, choropleth map and  bubble chart are coordinated in indication. Any item indicated by hovering in table view, choropleth map and  bubble chart will be 
      highlighted in other plots.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Interaction</h2>


<h3>Scatter plot</h3>
<p>
    The current implementation supports either zoom or brush functionality on the scatter plot at a time. we decided to implement brushing functionality instead.
    Brushing can be done in the scatter plot view by clicking the mouse anywhere on the scatter plot followed by drag and release to select 
    a region. Brusing in the above implementation is performed using rectangular brushed regions. Any items that fall in the brushed region 
    are selected. Selected items are shown in the  scatter plot using a black colored stroke.
</p>   

<h3>Table view </h3>
<p>
   Selection in table view is done by double clicking on the row for selecting a single element. For selecting multiple rows click on a row and drag the mouse 
   to the top or bottom based on the direction in which the selection is to be made. There are performance issues associated with multiple row selection in case 
   of table view in the current implementation which will be addressed later which causes the multi row selection to not perform consistently always. The selected
   rows have a red colored text font. Indication is done in table view by hovering the mouse over the row. The indicated row is shown using a "teal" background color. 

</p>
 

<h3>Choropleth map</h3>
Selection is done on the choropleth map by clicking twice on a country with a small time gap between clicks otherwise the interaction will also 
trigger zoom along with selection. Selected regions are filled with grey color. Indication is done by hovering the mouse over the country. Indicated regions 
will be highlighted with a blue border and a reduced opacity.
<p>

</p>

<h3>Bubble chart</h3>
<p>
  Selection is done on the bubble chart by clicking twice on a bubble. Selected items are filled with grey color. Indication is done by hovering the 
  mouse over the bubble. Indicated items will be highlighted with a white border and a reduced opacity.
</p>
<h3>Parallel coordinate plot</h3>
<p>
   The above parallel coordinate plot does not allow selection or hovering. It will only display selected items when selected in a corresponding coordinated view.
