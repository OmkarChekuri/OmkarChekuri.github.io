              An experiment was designed to explore the audience’s perspective
              on online commercials and analyze the relationship between the
              audience’s cognitive behavior and their eye movements. A group of
              twenty participants were chosen to participate in the experiment.
              The participants were divided into two groups and were asked to
              watch a YouTube video. The first group watched a video with a
              countdown function only and the other group watched the same video
              with a countdown function and a skip button. All subject’s eye
              movements were recorded by using an eye tracking that measures eye
              fixations durations counts. Afterwards, participants were asked to
              complete a questionnaire regarding a commercial that was shown
              before the video. Quantitative analysis was performed to determine
              the effect of skip function used in an online commercial. The
              visual scanning behavior of the individual participants was also
              analyzed by comparing their scan path sequences with their
              questionnaire responses. The quantitative analysis did not provide
              any substantial evidence by showing that there is no significant
              difference between the means of the eye fixation durations and eye
              fixation counts between the two scenarios with skip function and
              without skip function whereas the qualitative analysis showed some
              interesting results which showed that there is a difference
              between the cognitive behavior of the two groups.

              Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an area of machine learning where
              an agent learns by interacting with the environment by taking a
              sequence of actions to gain rewards on accomplishing some goal.
              The aim here is gain maximum cumulative rewards by taking the best
              possible actions. The environment is a model that represents the
              real-world problem/scenarios where decisions need to be made to
              achieve an end goal. Some of the examples of such environments are
              games, autonomous driving etc. In our problem we designed a game
              environment from scratch that is used for generating and solving
              dynamic perfect mazes. We used two reinforcement algorithms
              Q-learning and Multi agent Sarsa to solve these mazes. We compared
              the performance of these reinforcement learning algorithms with a
              maze solving algorithm. The result showed that Q-learning and
              Sarsa gave better result than Wall Follower algorithm in term of
              the number of steps taken to reach the goal. They can also solve
              the maze with a projectile. However, the solving becomes more
              difficult the bigger the maze is.

              We designed and developed a 2.5D platformer game. This game
              includes essential elements like animation, collision detection,
              shaders, a particle system, and basic physics. Throughout the
              development of our game, we meticulously applied software
              engineering processes, dividing our tasks into distinct phases:
              Requirement gathering and analysis, Design, Implementation,
              Testing, Analysis, and Reporting. However, rather than adhering
              strictly to these processes, we structured our workflow into six
              milestones. These milestones encompassed building the game
              framework, creating an alpha version, completing individual
              facets, integrating these facets, testing, and concluding with
              reporting. Moreover, our development journey significantly
              enriched our software development skills. We honed our abilities
              in various aspects of computer graphics, such as animation,
              collision detection, shaders, and particle systems. These skills
              were pivotal in crafting a visually captivating and immersive
              gaming experience. Through hands-on experience and
              experimentation, we deepened our understanding of advanced
              graphics techniques, enhancing our proficiency in this domain.

              The project focuses on distributed Sudoku solving, leveraging
              clients and servers within a Docker environment. This innovative
              approach utilizes pre-existing public key pairs for secure
              communication between clients and servers. Additionally, the
              system manages server-side storage for Sudoku puzzles and
              maintains active client lists for efficient connectivity. A
              pivotal feature of the project is the implementation of a Round
              Robin scheduling algorithm, facilitated by server-side token
              allocation. This mechanism allows clients to acquire tokens,
              enabling effective communication with neighboring clients and
              ensuring system redundancy. Moreover, communication protocols are
              standardized through method signatures defined in a dedicated
              proto file. These signatures govern essential functions like key
              exchange and encrypted message transmission, ensuring seamless and
              secure communication. In addition to its core functionality, the
              project includes a Distributed Sudoku solver within Docker. Server
              manages a 9x9 Sudoku matrix, distributing 3x3 submatrices to
              clients for collaborative puzzle solving. This integration
              showcases the system's adaptability and capacity to tackle complex
              computational tasks effectively.

              Most of the computer Graphics research has focused on
              photorealistic rendering and not much on artistic rendering.
              Artistic rendering can be achieved by controlling the color,
              shape, size of the brush strokes. In this paper I tried to
              replicate the ideas about abstract image representations from
              [Haeberli 1990]. Although I did not get the exact same results as
              [Haeberli 1990], I followed and implemented some of the techniques
              described in the paper and achieved reasonable results with
              artistic elements.
