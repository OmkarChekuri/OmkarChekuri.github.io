    <div id="intro">
      <h1>Welcome to the Global Population Visualization</h1>
      <p>
        This webpage presents two distinct visualizations that shed light on the
        populations of national animals and humans across various countries. The
        visualizations provide an engaging way to explore both animal and human
        data side-by-side.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="chart-area1">
      <h3>Chart 1: Animal Population Bar Chart</h3>
      <p>
        The <b>Animal Population Bar Chart</b> focuses on the national animals
        of each country. For example, you'll see the <em>Kangaroo</em> for
        Australia, the <em>panda</em> for China, and so on. These animals are
        symbols of national pride and are represented with their corresponding
        population for each year. Each bar is accompanied by the respective
        national <em>flag</em> and <em>animal icon</em> to make the chart
        visually intuitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chart uses a <b>logarithmic scale</b> to accommodate the wide range
        of animal populations, from the thousands to the millions. The
        population of each national animal evolves over time, and you can track
        these changes dynamically.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="chart-area2">
      <h3>Chart 2: Grouped Bar Chart (Animals and Humans)</h3>
      <p>
        The <b>Grouped Bar Chart</b> allows for a comparison between
        <em>human populations</em> and <em>animal populations</em> for each
        country. This chart highlights the relationship between the human
        population and their national animal population, allowing you to see
        which countries have a higher animal-to-human ratio or vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, you may notice that in some countries, the animal
        population is relatively small compared to the human population, while
        in others, the animal population might be surprisingly high. The bars
        are grouped by country, with different colors representing the human and
        animal data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chart uses a <b>logarithmic scale</b> to accommodate the wide range
        of animal populations and human populaion, from the thousands to the
        billions. The population of each national animal and people evolves over
        time, and you can track these changes dynamically.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chart updates over time, showing how populations change from year to
        year. Keep an eye on the transitions as the data shifts, and feel free
        to explore the relationship between human and animal populations.
