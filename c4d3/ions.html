      <h3>Background</h3>

      <p>
        The above example shows a coordination visualization in D3 using the <b>Live properties</b> architecture of
        <b><a href="https://www.cs.ou.edu/~weaver/improvise/index.html"> Improvise </a></b>software. The data for the
        following visualization is taken from <a href="https://www.cs.ou.edu/~weaver/improvise/examples/ions/index.html"
          target="_blank">ions visualization</a>.

      </p>

      <h3> Interface</h3>

      <p>Clicking on the image shown above will open the visualization in a new window. The visualization displays
        different spatial and temporal aspects of a simulated ion cloud trajectory organized
        column wise. A highly coordinated set of timeseries plots, table views and other views reveal different
        characteristics of
        oscillatory motion. The trajectory is displayed in a variety of ways by the views in the visualization. Each
        view is
        embedded in a rectangular region with a <b>thick border</b> on the top. Each view can be independently
        moved, and the <b>interface</b> can be <b>reorganized</b> by clicking and dragging the <b>thick border</b> on
        the top of each view.
      </p>

      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The first column from left consists of three time series scatter plots that show ion motion over time
          relative to X, Y and Z axis.</li>
        <li>The second, third, fourth and fifth columns consists of scatter plots drawn in a combination of different
          axis.</li>
        <li> The third column and fourth column consist of a parallel coordinate plot that shows the data in all the
          dimensions. </li>
        <li>The sixth column from the left shows a table view with the actual (T, X, Y, Z) positions of points along the
          trajectory.</li>
        <li> The sixth column from the left below the table view shows a perpetual view with a color gradient mapped on
          to a rectangular region. </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All views map time into a translucent red-to-black color gradient that suggests (but does not map precisely to)
        decreasing energy of the ion cloud over time.
      </p>

      <h3>Coordination</h3>

      <ul>
        <li> The three scatter plots in the first column and the table view are coordinated in selection. </li>
        <li> The three scatter plots in the first column are connected in range along horizontal axis.</li>
        <li> The scatter plots in the second and third column from left consists of overview scatter plots for the
          detailed views in the scatter plot
          in fourth and fifth columns. The Top scatter plot in the second column and the top scatter plot in the fifth
          column are overview-detail pairs.
          The bottom scatter plot in the second column and the bottom scatter plot in the fourth column are overview and
          detail pairs. The bottom
          scatter plot in the third column and the bottom scatter plot in the fifth column are overview and detail
          pairs.</li>
        <li> The parallel coordinate plot and the perpetual slider are coordinated in selection.</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Interaction </h3>


      <h4> Scatter plot </h4>
      <p>
        The current implementation supports either zoom or brush on the scatter plot at a time. we decided to implement
        brush property instead.
        Brushing can be done in the scatterplot view by clicking the mouse anywhere on the scatterplot followed by drag
        and release to select a brushed region.
        Brushing in the above implementation is performed using rectangular brushed regions. Any items that fall in the
        brushed region are selected.
        Selected items are shown in the scatter plot using a black colored stroke.

        Brushing on the scatter plots in the first column will select items in the coordinated views to the plot on
        which the brushing is performed.
        Brushing performed on any of the overview plot will draw a detailed plot for the brushed region. Brushing
        performed on the detailed view will not have any effect
        as no coordination is defined for the brushing action.
      </p>

      <h4> Parallel coordinate plot </h4>
      <p>
        The above parallel coordinate plot does not allow selection or hovering. It will only display selected items
        from a corresponding coordinated view.
        The selected items are drawn using thick lines.
      </p>


      <h4> Table view </h4>
      <p>
        Selection in table view is done by double clicking on the row for selecting a single element. For selecting
        multiple rows click on a row
        and drag the mouse to the top or bottom based on the direction in which the selection is to be made. There are
        performance issues associated
        with multi row selection in case of table view in the current implementation which will be addressed later which
        causes the multiple selection
        to not perform consistently. The selected rows have a red colored text font. The table view and the scatter
        plots in the first column
        are coordinated in selection.
      </p>

      <h4> Perpetual slider </h4>
      <p>
        The perpetual slider and the parallel coordinate plot are coordinated in selection. Selection is performed in
        the perpetual slider by brushing.
        The slider is filled with a color gradient approximately corresponding to increasing time scale in the data. Any
        selection performed in the slider
        will select the corresponding data points in the linked parallel coordinate plot.
