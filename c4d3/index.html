      <b>C4D3</b> is a framework that provides view level abstraction and coordination architecture for developing
      coordinated multiple
      views using <b>D3</b> library. The journey to developing the C4D3 framework began when we discovered the potential
      and need of a coordination architecture
      for building coordinated multiple views (CMV) for the visualizations built in browser environment. We chose to
      adopt
      Live properties
      architecture for this purpose after understanding its potential and generalizability. The whole process can be
      roughly categorized into following steps.

      <li> Design and analysis </li>

    </ol>
    </p>


    <h3> Planning and understanding </h3>
    <p>
      Our aim of this project was to develop a coordination framework for the web environment where users should be able
      to build complex coordinated visualizations
      in the browser environment by achieving comparative performance to that of the desktop applications. We creating a
      rough plan of what the visualization framework
      might work like, design of the user interface of the visualization and how a visualization designer might use the
      library to build visualizations using
      D3 library.

      To understand how a coordinated visualization works with Html and SVG widgets, we created simple Html and SVG
      widgets and started coordinating them in a
      variety of ways. For example, we used sliders to manipulate the DOM and various properties of SVG objects. As a
      process we gained better
      understanding of how the program gets complex with increasing number of ways of coordination between the widgets.

      link to view the example visualization.
    <h3></h3>
    </p>

    <h3> Design and analysis </h3>
    <p>
      The design and analysis started with discussions about the level of abstraction provided for the user. We started
      to
      design and sketch the framework
      and analyzed how different aspects need to be implemented. We chose Live properties coordination architecture of
      the
      <a href="https://www.cs.ou.edu/~weaver/improvise/index.html">Improvise </a> visualization system to be the
      coordination architecture for C4D3.

    </p>

    <h3> Developing the coordination architecture and view abstractions</h3>
    <p>
      We started conversion of the Live Properties package which is written in Java into JavaScript. Soon we encountered
      many
      difficulties associated with the conversion as JavaScript is not object oriented. We also faced difficulties due
      to
      its limited
      features like lack of strict typing, support of optional parameters, support during compilation. We moved our code
      to typescript
      as it provides the advantages needed for clean one on one conversion of Java Code to Typescript code. We carefully
      implemented
      essential functionality of coordination architecture supported by Typescript library.

      We created view level abstractions for Html and SVG widgets (slider, text box, numerical input, rectangle) to make
      them work
      with the coordination architecture.


    </p>

    <h3> Developing and testing of initial version of C4D3 framework</h3>

    <p>
      We combined the coordination architecture and view level abstractions to build the initial version of C4D3. The
      framework was combined
      in such a way that the user will be able to create the variables, instantiate the views using view abstractions
      and
      parameters, define the
      ways of coordination between various views in a central location. This gives the user the ability and abstraction
      required to define the
      coordination mechanism between different views in a clean and centralized manner. This also gives the user the
      much
      needed control to change the coordination between views
      without the need to change the D3 code that builds the visualization. Our limited experience in building browser
      based visualization systems cost us
      most of our time in the development of the initial version of framework. Our main challenges here include setting
      up
      the software environment
      for the testing and debugging of the framework for iterative development of the framework.
    </p>

    <p>
      We created multiple coordinated views using the Html and SVG widgets to test the working of C4D3 framework.

      link
      to view the example visualization.


    </p>


    <h3> Extending the coordination architecture and view abstraction for D3 library</h3>
    <p>
      Once the framework is in place, we started to develop view level abstractions for D3 visualizations like
      scatterplot, table view,
      parallel coordinate plot, choropleth map, bubble chart and bar graph. We started abstracting the appearance and
      behavior of the visualizations
      to support basic selection and navigation patterns. The D3 type definitions for typescript are essential for
      building and extending the architecture to
      D3 library. Lack of type definitions for other available visualization libraries limited out testing and
      experimenting on extending the architecture
      to support them. Some of the challenges faced in this step include making changes to the view abstractions for
      updating the
      views in an efficient manner without impacting the performance of the browser although some performance issues may
      be noticed.
    </p>

    <h3> Building examples of coordinated visualizations using C4D3</h3>
    <p>
      Once the required view types in D3 are ready, we created two examples of complex coordinated visualizations using
      the C4D3 framework. One of the them
      being partial reimplementation of the <b><a
          href="https://www.cs.ou.edu/~weaver/improvise/examples/ions/index.html">
          Ions visualization </a> </b>
      originally created using <a href="https://www.cs.ou.edu/~weaver/improvise/index.html">Improvise </a> and the other
      one being a novel implementation of
      <b>COVID-19 visualization</b> from the COVID-19 dataset. The <b>links</b> to the above <b>examples</b> are
      provided
      in the navigation bar on the top of page
      under <strong>Examples</strong> section. As and when required to support different interaction behavior for the
      visualization examples, we extended
      the functionality of the view abstractions for the views to support complex coordinated visualizations. We
      parameterized the essential behavior and appearance
      of the D3 views to give the designer ability to instantiate the views using the view wrappers provided. These view
      wrappers do not cover all the possible
      design choices to be made. Any special appearance and behavior that the designer needs and the view does not
      provide
      will require minimal work from the designer in modifying the view
      abstractions. We aim to modify the framework to let the user inherit the view abstraction provided and define
      their
      special code in a sub class.
